    <p>Story of the band began around 2015 when me and Markus joined their forces together and<br>
    started to think about forming an unique metal band. I had already written some of the<br>
    material so all we needed was some capable musicians to join with us. Soon we found a singer<br>
    and a bassist and started practicing together. Later we discovered a drummer and the band was ready.<br>
    During this time I had a lot of motivation to finish our songs and also the joining<br>
    musicians contributed with songs of their own.</p>

    <p>Albeit of a promising start, we disbanded due to several reasons or for no reasons at all.</p>

    <p>After about two years I thought that I must do something about these songs. I contacted<br>
    Markus again and we started searching new musicians for this project. I asked my brother Petri<br>
    to play bass and he almost immediately accepted. Then I started scrolling through<br>
    muusikoiden.net. Finnish forum for musicians. I also wrote to the wanted section, looking for a singer and a drummer.<br>
    I don’t exactly recall did Roni and Eetu contact me or did I contact them<br>
    but both were a perfect match for the band and luckily they joined without a lot of hesitation.<br></p>
    
    <p>So around 2018, The Divergent was formed.</p>
    
    <p>Our first goal was to finish all the 5 songs. So Roni started working on lyrics and vocal<br>
    arrangements. Lyrics turned out to be great and they revolved around themes like self<br>
    improvement and self awareness. Since I had wrote the drums pretty much copy/pasting the<br>
    sections. I left them in the hands of Eetu who added more variety to them plus well needed fills.<br>
    Petri contributed on some of the bass arrangements adding a bit of groove and fills aswell.</p>

    <p>After all the songs made sense they were ready to be recorded. Eetu had a friend called Markus<br>
    Suomela of M/S Audio Productions who we contacted and he was more than willing to do the<br>
    recordings. Drums were recorded in his studio between two days. Guitar and bass tracks were<br>
    recorded at home and sent to Markus for reamping. Roni recorded vocals at our training place<br>
    and then sent them to the studio for mixing. Whole recording process took maybe 2-3 months<br>
    before final mixing/mastering which took about 3-4 weeks.</p>

    <p>After recordings we decided to shoot a music video. We decided to contact Pete Welling of<br>
    Welling creations because he seemed to have previous experince of working with finnish bands<br>
    like Kotiteollisuus. The video was shot in an old sausage factory which was waiting for<br>
    demolition. It took place at the end of march and we were very happy with the end result.</p>

    <p>The future looks promising for The Divergent.</p>
    
    <p>All the best,<br>
    Harri Moilanen / Guitarist</p>
